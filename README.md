# Iris-Classifier
This is a Machine learning project.  
Its based on supervised learning.  
The classifier's that are trained on the dataset that are then later used to classifiy the new problems.  
It just classifiy that to which class it belongs to.  
The dataset is taken from the "uci repository"  
This is just a basic predictor.  
Every time when we run it it first train the classifier and then test it.
